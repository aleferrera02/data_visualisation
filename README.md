# Data Visualisation : Cost of life and salaries in European countries
 
 International students and workers are greatly attracted by the possibilities offered by
 Switzerland in terms of salaries and work opportunities. But is this actually a good
 choice, considering how notoriously high the cost of life in the country is? Wouldnâ€™t
 it be more favourable to live in a country with lower average salaries but also lower
 costs to face? This analysis takes into consideration various factors to assess the ratio
 between living expenses and wages across European states and also aims to establish if
 the presence of good universities in a country impacts this proportion, offering insights
 into the broader impact of higher education institutions on economic balance and
 opportunities.
